# Goal
This project aims to be the best (desktop) chinese reading companion in several respects:

1. Smart word segmentation and dictionary lokoup: Upon clicking on a character, finds the best matching word around this character and produces all its dictionary entries.
2. Make the nicest possible Anki flashcards out of the words you looked up, complete with an excerpt of the sentence context the word occured in.

# Usage
TODO

$$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$

# Features that are to be implemented
* A UI :)
* Flashcard export.
* Better interoperability with traditional Chinese.
* Pinyin tone marks instead of tone numbers.
* Batch processing of a whole text to extract all (unknown) words into a complete Anki deck.
